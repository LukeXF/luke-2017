He's a very creative individual and his skill set has made a positive impact on both Premier Gun Club's and Hot Brass Media's sales and online brand identity. Looking forward to the next great project we work on together."

		"feedback": "Luke is an easy going guy, very flexible and helpful around my working schedule. I had great fun working with him on the Black Wolf Inc website. After sending me several designs and playing around with the layouts, we eventually mixed and matches the best of each design to build the final website. Was a pleasure working with luke and he even taught me a thing or two about coding."

		"feedback": "We needed a new redesign for our website to keep our online presence active. Luke came into our offices and we worked together on the requirements for the new website. A few days later he came back with the design prototype, which after we approved we got our site up and running a couple weeks later and it even works on mobiles now. Thanks Luke!"
